#**The MediCode**

##1. Executive Summary 

Keeping up with the ever-increasing medical records is becoming a bigger hassle. If only there were a way to convey critical information in a medical emergency. What if only there were a way to keep up with your medical status and those around you? Introducing MediCode- the most convenient medical record database outfitted with the latest and fastest data access technologies.
MediCode is a health and wellness aid application with a secure database catered to the individual consisting of their health history and records accessible via various quick access technologies such as QR codes and NFC tags. The database is a secure 2-way interface between a patient and a doctor and can be updated accordingly by both sides. MediCode paves the way for individual medical literacy and allows convenient data and record sharing while having multiple encryptions and secure logins to ensure data safety. It is primarily targeted at the older generation and those needing to keep a check on their medical conditions and needs. Still, it can be helpful to the entire populace as it tackles issues faced by every person.
The database has preset data organizers, facilitating quick and easy data compilation and withdrawal. This keeps all data clear, concise, and easy to digest for users with varying levels of medical literacy.
In addition to being a concise and easy-to-access database, MediCode features 2 more distinct features-
Quick Emergency Information Access—In an emergency, MediCode allows open access to pre-set emergency health information detailing a patient's extenuating health conditions and a guide for first responders. 
Proximity Ping—If a patient is diagnosed with a contagious disease, their doctor can add a ping to their record. This will allow the app to ping nearby devices to spread awareness and prevent the spread of the disease.
MediCode is the one-stop solution for all medical data-related hassles, making storing and retrieving data seamless and instant. It simplifies the process, enabling everyone to keep track of their health records and medical conditions.  From the healthiest adult to the most chronically Ill, MediCode aims to be the greatest medical tool you can ask for.


##2. Market Research and Need Analysis

Miscommunication, delays in patient care, and the loss of records are critical reasons why change is necessary to improve the security and access to medical information.  “Major problems with traditional paper medical records include lack of standardization across physicians and healthcare facilities, poor searchability and loss of information.”(National Library of Medicine)   Having medical information stored on paper is risky, with a high chance of being damaged or lost.  To address these issues, a digital form of storing records, updating and sharing information with patients and doctors, and a secure database to store medical information is crucial. 
“Nearly two-thirds (63.4%) of US adults have used an app for a health-related purpose in the last 12 months.” (EMarketer) Currently, there are a few main health apps or apps that allow you to upload many documents in one place at one time.  For example, Apple has an app called AppleHealth, which keeps track of medical records and physical activity.  This app is limited to IOS users; only 28% of the population uses Apple devices.  This limits the market you can reach with the product. (SkillAdemia). 
Another example is MyQRcode, an application that allows you to import documents into its database. Accessing these documents is as easy as scanning a QR code. The critical issue with this app is that you need a subscription to keep your data maintained and active. Once your subscription is inactive, you cannot log into your data. Most QR codes aren't inherently secure and lack security features like password protection or encryption for your sensitive information.
Most QR code generators provide a free service for creating basic/static QR codes. However, this limits your ability to change what is on the QR code (dynamic QR codes), lacks customization to your data, and requires a membership fee to sustain your website/link/QR code. MediCode allows you to manage and update your records flexibly without a subscription.
MediCode (our product) will address these issues by making an application accessible on all devices and software. It will provide data encryption and dynamic QR codes without paying for a subscription. MediCode will have quick access to emergency information (even offline) but require Two-Factor authentication to access all other records such as insurance, medical history, and more.  Being able to access emergency information without the internet can be critical.  Medical records have been getting stolen and exposed more and more each year.  In 2023 alone, “an astonishing 133 million records exposed, stolen, or otherwise impermissibly disclosed.”(Hippa Journal) 


##3. Product Description

The MediCode is a scannable and wearable QR code that upon being scanned, will allow the scanner to gain access to the person’s medical data to gain information like their vitals, pre-existing medical conditions, allergies, and any other essential knowledge that could benefit the patient.  In this way, it allows people who are more at risk of health problems to be treated with a better idea of their medical history. The person scanning will use a QR code to take the scanner to the patient's medical records, which are stored on a secure server. It is a unique and secure two-way interface for the patient and helper to share information discretely and efficiently.
There could be multiple places where one could wear the code, so we could make it in various formats, such as a hat, wristband, or other easily identifiable pieces of clothing that are quick to find. In the case of an emergency, this would allow the scanner to plan for the patient’s health and tailor it to their needs.
MediCode would work by initially scanning the QR code, revealing relevant emergency information that the first responder can use to contact paramedics or other healthcare professionals or provide immediate assistance. That way, patients with specific restrictions and information about their care can get the tailored help they require. 
Proximity ping is a unique feature that allows medical professionals to add tags to a user's profile to ensure public safety. If a contagious disease is tagged on a user's profile, MediCode sends a ping to nearby users to take precautions.  This promotes public awareness and encourages proper protocol against infectious or contagious diseases. 
The primary database can be accessed through the app via a secure login featuring two-factor authentication.  This ensures that your information is encrypted and secured in MediCode.  The database features a tabular structure with various medical categories that are easily accessible.  The user and their doctors can add or edit records while maintaining the structure and uniformity of MediCode.  The accessibility and efficiency of the user interface will allow medical assistance to flourish and adapt for anybody in need. In this way, doctors and medical professionals can access vital information with the click of a finger.

##4. Possible Problems and Counterarguments
Mobile medical database apps' security and vulnerability to cyber-attacks and data leaks are significant concerns. However, through various layers of encryption, secure log-ins, and 2FA, we plan to provide our users with complete data security. Medicode is to be set so that only pinged medical contagious details are shared among users for awareness. There is no other form of communication between the databases of different users. 
There are also possible concerns with updating the database to facilitate data input by both doctors and users. However, because it is set up as a peer-to-peer database, it is not only secure but easily accessible and updates in real-time on both sides.
There also lies the issue of users losing their NFC tags or QR codes, letting others gain access to their data. However, the database has been set up to only display emergency information immediately upon any scans, and the primary database will be locked behind a login and 2FA.
But won’t the database have the same hassle as handling various physical medical records? The database has preset data organizers that allow quick and easy data compilation and withdrawal. This keeps all data clear, concise, and easy to digest for users with varying levels of medical literacy.
The major obstacle for the project lies in its ability to get certified by medical professionals and, therefore, be greenlit for widespread use. This is simply a matter of time, as most concerns with data security and handling have been clearly addressed, and a proper roadmap has been shared.

##5. Conclusion and Recommendations
MediCode addresses critical flaws in the current standardized medical system. It allows records to be stored in a compound and secure database while still being openly accessible to the public and medical professionals. The product aims to prevent unnecessary deaths caused by a lack of immediate knowledge and assistance in cases of emergency.
Every year, 805,000 Americans suffer a heart attack. Of those, about 375,476 died. In that same amount of time, upwards of 795,000 Americans suffer a stroke. 195,000 die from it. In both of these cases about 1 in 4 of the victims, surviving or otherwise,  had histories of the respective incidents. Imagine how many could have been saved if the people around them could immediately narrow down what the issue could be to a few possibilities, and share the information with the first responders or dispatchers.
With MediCode, anyone with a mobile phone who notices someone having a medical incident of any kind, whether heart attack, stroke, allergic reaction, or otherwise, can immediately see what it could be, and provide appropriate first aid to the victim or relay appropriate information to emergency services. Even first responders could use it to determine the most likely causes and apply immediate assistance.  As a tool for both uninformed bystanders and experienced first responders, MediCode could save hundreds of thousands of lives from spontaneous medical incidents.
